# Overview:
* I was provided one Power BI file with the dataset containing several columns with different statuses i.e. "recovered", "deaths" & "confirmed", countries affected,
date column, Country name, coronna cases, etc.

## Requirements of the report:

## Tools Used: Power BI, Figma, Logomakr.com

After loading the dataset in Power BI, I applied the following applications...

# Understanding of data:
Primary task of the dataset was to make a single-paged report which gives insights regarding the COVID spread across different countries with number of Coronna cases
recovered, confirmed and deaths.On the basis of the dataset, as a analyst I was required to prepare a report which gave some insights on the coronna cases.

# Application of DAX measures:
* During the making of this dashboard, I applied several DAX measures. One of the measures I applied at first was to filter the "COVID-19 Fact" Dataset with "Status" of
different types in 3 tables separately with "Confirmed Cases", "Recovered Cases" and "Death Cases" using FILTER functionality.

* Then, for finding Average Cases of different statuses I used CALCULATE measure for it.

# Visualization In Power BI:

## Theme and Color Palette:
* I used dark theme here for this dashboard.
* Colors chosen: Red, Black, Green and Orange.

## Visualization:
Here, I used Figma for making background here in healthcare report with ratio 16:9 with 720*1280px 

# Conclusion:
Overall, it was a good dataset to visualize and it improved my understanding of DAX measures and visualization techniques.
